# Piano Studio

A browser piano studio: play an 88-key piano with synthesized sound, read along with real
sheet music, import/export MIDI and MusicXML, and practice with two games.

## Features

**Play**
- Full 88-key piano (A0–C8) with mouse, touch (multi-pointer) or computer keyboard.
- Realistic, velocity-sensitive Web Audio piano synthesis: inharmonic partials, per-note decay,
  hammer noise, stereo spread and reverb — no samples to download, works fully offline.
- Optional Web MIDI keyboard input (`Connect MIDI`) — play and see the keys light up.
- Live note readout shows exactly which keys are sounding, and both hands are colour-coded.
- Damper pedal toggle, octave shift, QWERTY labels on keys.

**Read**
- Grand-staff notation view rendered with VexFlow: key/time signatures, accidentals, beams, rests,
  ledger lines, two voices per staff, hands split across treble and bass.
- Playback highlights the notes that are sounding and auto-scrolls to the current system.
- Click any measure to seek; click the falling-note view anywhere to seek too.
- Falling-note piano-roll view aligned to a live keyboard strip.
- Transport: play/pause, stop, seek, tempo 50–150 %, loop, metronome, bar.beat readout.

**Import / export**
- Import `.mid`, `.midi`, `.musicxml`, `.xml`, `.mxl` (compressed MusicXML) and Piano Studio `.json`.
- Export the current score as **MusicXML** (sheet), **MIDI**, **JSON** (project) or **SVG** (sheet).
- Recording: hit Record, play on the piano, hit Record again — your take is quantized into a score
  that you can read, play back and export as sheet music.
- Demo library: Twinkle Twinkle, Ode to Joy, Für Elise, Canon in D, C major scale.
- Imported and recorded songs persist in the browser.

**Practice games**
- **Falling Notes** — notes fall toward the hit line; press the matching key. Perfect/great/good
  timing windows, combo, multiplier, accuracy, results rank, per-run length (short/full), tempo
  control, metronome and an assist mode that quietly plays the target notes.
- **Ear & Key Training** — 10 rounds, two modes: hear a note and find it, or find a named key.
  Streak, score, timing bonus, keyboard and on-screen input.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev        # http://localhost:5173
```

Production build and tests:

```bash
npm run build      # type-check + bundle to dist/
npm run preview    # serve the build (http://localhost:4173)
npm test           # Vitest suite
```

The app needs a modern browser with Web Audio (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari). Audio starts after
the first click/keypress because of browser autoplay rules. Web MIDI is optional and depends on
browser support.

## Controls

| Action | Input |
| --- | --- |
| Play notes | Click/touch keys, or `A S D F G H J K` (white) and `W E T Y U` (black) |
| Octave shift | `Z` / `X`, or the − / + buttons |
| Play / pause | `Space`, or the transport button |
| Seek | Click a measure in the sheet, click the piano roll, or use the seek slider |
| Pedal / labels | Buttons above the keyboard |
| Games | `Games` tab → choose a game |

The QWERTY mapping is relative to the octave shown above the keyboard (`Oct 4` = C4). Game views
use the same mapping.

## Format notes / known limitations

- Internal scores are stored in quarter-note beats with a tempo map; MIDI ticks and MusicXML
  divisions are converted on import.
- The score model has a single global key signature; key changes later in an imported file are
  shown/exported with the first key signature.
- MusicXML has no velocity, so imported notes use a default velocity; MIDI/recorded velocities are
  preserved.
- MusicXML export writes sharps for black keys and snaps time-signature changes to bar lines.
- `.mxl` import expects a UTF-8 MusicXML score; `score-timewise` files are rejected with a clear
  message.
- SVG export renders the notation; MusicXML is the editable/interchange format.

## Project layout

```
src/
  App.tsx                 app shell, library, transport wiring, import/export UI
  components/             keyboard, piano roll, transport, song library, games landing
  hooks/                  piano engine lifecycle, playback scheduler, QWERTY/MIDI input, recorder
  audio/                  Web Audio piano engine + synthesis + offline self-test
  music/                  score model, timing/tempo math, pitch helpers, demo songs, recording
  music/formats/          MIDI + MusicXML parsers/writers, .mxl import, quantization, JSON
  sheet/                  VexFlow grand-staff renderer, layout, highlighting, SVG export
  game/                   falling-notes game, ear/key quiz, scoring and quiz logic
  styles.css              theme and layout
```

Playback is a look-ahead scheduler: notes are scheduled into the AudioContext ~0.9 s ahead while a
30 fps UI clock drives highlighting. All musical positions are beats; seconds are derived through
`src/music/timing.ts`, so tempo changes and seeking stay consistent.

## Verification

- Unit tests cover timing/tempo math, pitch/key signatures, score normalisation, recording
  quantization, MIDI/MusicXML round-trips, `.mxl` import, quantization, VexFlow layout helpers,
  audio voice/engine behaviour and game scoring/quiz logic.
- The audio engine has an offline self-test (`?audiotest` in the app) that renders individual notes
  and a chord through `OfflineAudioContext` and reports peak/RMS levels.
- The app was exercised end-to-end in headless Chrome: playback highlights keys and advances the
  clock, the falling-notes game scores key presses, the quiz advances, and every export format
  downloads and re-imports.

Demo songs are traditional / public domain. Built with React, Vite, TypeScript, VexFlow and fflate.
